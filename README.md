Throughout the whole analysis, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, Linear SVM, and KNN were used as the classifier to help predict book ratings. 
Since a large dataset was given with various features, the chi-square test is used for feature selection. The train-test split was also used to help evaluate modelsâ€™ performance regarding general unseen data. 
Moreover, visualisation approaches like as bar plots, heat maps, and box plots help audiences understand data distribution and provide evidence for some of the author's decisions. 
After hyperparameter tuning for each model, evaluations were run with the test set split from a training set and therefore compared the performance of each classification method. 
Overall, multinomial naive Bayes predicted best with the highest accuracy and KNN made the worst prediction. 
Heat maps for confusion matrix clearly depict the distribution of true positive, false positive, and so on.
 Simple descriptions of each feature were included, as an additional explanation of the offered dataset,
